## üöÄ About The Project

I originally built this portfolio as a multi-page website. To modernize the user experience and create a more fluid narrative, I refactored it into a single-page application. This version guides visitors through a clean, linear story of my skills and projects, all without ever needing to refresh the page.

The design is clean, fully responsive, and features subtle animations to make the experience more engaging.

## üåü Key Features

- **Single-Page Layout:** All content is accessible on one page for a fast and uninterrupted experience.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Navigation links smoothly animate the scroll to the corresponding section.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
- **Interactive Project Showcase:** A clean grid layout displays my projects with links to live demos.
- **Animations on Scroll:** Elements subtly fade in as they enter the viewport, powered by the AOS library.
- **Functional Contact Form:** An integrated EmailJS form allows visitors to send messages directly to my inbox.
